**Objectives**

**US Healthcare Data Analysis**

 Cost Optimization, Demographics Insights, and Resource Management 		
                                                        
**1. Demographic Analysis of Medical Conditions** 

:- I analyzed the dataset to identify the most prevalent medical condittions across different demographic groups, like age and gender. This helps hospitals understand which conditions are most common in certain groups.													
                                                        
**2. Patient Price Optimization**

:- I analyzed patient cost data and insurance information to find trends and recommend ways to reduce patient expenses. 						
                                                        
**3. Hospital Resource Management**

:- i analyzed hospital resource usage to identify opportunities for better management, such as optimizing staff allocation and equipment usage.														                                                       
                                                        
**Dataset we used** 

 The [Dataset](https://onedrive.live.com/personal/c7e8a452b587272f/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B8484e864-bbc5-4cf8-8969-6196ac83e995%7D&action=default&redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy9jN2U4YTQ1MmI1ODcyNzJmL0VXVG9oSVRGdV9oTWlXbGhscXlENlpVQlVVOVFGQUNrdXR1cUpqUERiQm9fS0E_ZT1IeGNFMVE&slrid=b421d2a1-4048-0000-f647-1f4f7747ccd9&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3gvYy9jN2U4YTQ1MmI1ODcyNzJmL0VXVG9oSVRGdV9oTWlXbGhscXlENlpVQlVVOVFGQUNrdXR1cUpqUERiQm9fS0E_cnRpbWU9aHQ1U1NRUVMza2c&CID=288c7f17-9de7-4533-876b-a3df01077700&_SRM=0:G:47) included of information from 100 hospitals with 10001 rows and 15 columns. It included patient info, addmission details, insurance data and more.  														

## Process

. Verify data for any missing values and anomalies, and sort out the same.
. Made sure data is consistent and clean with respect to data type, data format and values used.
. Created pivot tables according to the questions asked.
Â· Merge all pivot tables into one dashboard and apply slicer to make dynamic.

## Project Insights

. Hypertension is the most common condition; Diabetes is the least common.
. Middle-aged patients show the highest disease prevalence and treatment costs.
. Females have more overall conditions; Males lead in Hypertension.
. Blood type AB- records the highest number of medical conditions and Obesity cases.
. Cancer, Hypertension, and Diabetes contribute most to total healthcare expenses.
. Patients with Aetna, Cigna, and Medicare have higher average costs.
. Emergency admissions are the most expensive; Elective admissions cost the least.
. June, October, and November see peak admission volumes.
. Tuesday and Thursday have the highest admission counts.

## Final Conclusion 
The study shows that Hypertension is the most common health issue, mostly seen in middle-aged** and older people. Females have more health conditions overall, while males face more Hypertension cases. Emergency admissions and months like June, October, and November increase costs. Focusing on prevention, cost control, and good resource planning can help improve hospital performance and reduce expenses.
